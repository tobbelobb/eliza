The two Hangprinter configuration files exhibit several key differences in their G-code commands and settings. 

1. **Kinematic Mapping**: The first configuration uses `M584` to map motors to CAN addresses (X40.0, Y41.0, etc.), while the second directly maps them to SKR 3 driver ports (X0, Y1, Z2, U3).

2. **Anchor Points**: The first file includes specific anchor point coordinates defined in `M669` with a detailed format, while the second file specifies anchor points with real-world measurements but in a simpler format.

3. **Mechanical Parameters**: The first configuration specifies mechanical advantages, line counts, and gear teeth with multiple `M666` commands, whereas the second file condenses some parameters, indicating a uniform mechanical advantage and line count.

4. **Flex Compensation**: The first configuration includes detailed flex compensation settings (weights, spring constants, etc.), while the second file provides simplified values, particularly for the mover weight and spring constants.

5. **Drive Setup**: The first configuration defines drive directions for all motors, while the second file specifies only the first four motors with a consistent forward direction.

6. **Speeds and Accelerations**: The second configuration has different values for maximum speeds, accelerations, and motor currents compared to the first, indicating potential differences in performance tuning.

These differences reflect the varying setups and specific requirements of each Hangprinter installation.
