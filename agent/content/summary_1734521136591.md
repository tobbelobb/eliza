The Hangprinter configuration files detail critical setup parameters for the printer's operation, particularly focusing on the M669 and M666 commands, which play essential roles in defining the printer's kinematics and mechanical behavior.

### M669 Command
The M669 command is crucial for specifying the kinematics of the Hangprinter.
It defines the positions of the anchors in a three-dimensional space, which are essential for the printer's movement and accuracy.
The command uses a format that expresses the distances between pivot points of the lines when the machine is homed.
In both configurations, the M669 command is followed by parameters that set the machine type (K6 for Hangprinters) and the printable radius, which, while not currently utilized in Hangprinters, indicates the intended working area.

The output from the auto calibration script utilizes the M669 command to establish anchor points (A, B, C, D) based on measured distances, which informs the printer's control system about the physical layout and dimensions of the setup.
This is vital for ensuring precise movement and positioning during printing.

### M666 Command
The M666 command is used extensively to configure mechanical properties and compensation parameters for the Hangprinter.
It includes settings for spool buildup (Q), spool radii (R), mechanical advantages (A and U), the number of lines per spool (O), and various force limits (I, X, W, T).


- **Spool and Mechanical Parameters**: The command defines the spool mechanics, such as how many lines are active and their mechanical advantage, which influences how the printer compensates for weight and tension during operation.

- **Flex Compensation**: It allows for adjustments related to the weight of the mover (W), the spring constant (S), and the desired target force (T).
This is particularly important for maintaining print quality by ensuring consistent tension in the lines, which affects how the extruder moves and deposits material.
- **Safety Limits**: The parameters for minimum and maximum planned forces (I and X) establish safety limits that help prevent the printer from exceeding its mechanical capabilities, thus protecting both the machine and the print quality.

In summary, the M669 and M666 commands are integral to the Hangprinter's configuration, dictating its kinematic behavior and mechanical performance.
Proper setup of these commands is essential for achieving accurate and reliable printing results, as they directly influence how the printer interacts with its physical environment and manages the forces involved in the printing process.
