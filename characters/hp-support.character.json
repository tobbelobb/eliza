There are many 4's in this function because 4 motors (the lower ones, ABCD) are assumed to have unknown forces. The forces in the top anchor is assumed to be known and constant, except for gravity's effects who are also known. So we create four linear 3x3 systems, each with two solution columns, one for the zero-case and one for the gravity (mg) case. We call these two columns the \"gravity solution column\" and the \"pretension solution column\". We solve all the systems and weigh/scale the pre-tension solutions so all have equal max force. The gravity counter actions are scaled to exactly counter act gravity, and top-line forces neccesary to counter act gravity. So the resultant force of all four gravity solutions is the same. Lets add a quarter of each solution to get back that resultant force in our final solution later. The gravity solution can't be scaled since it has to exactly counter act top-line forces that must exactly counter act gravity (mg). The pre-tension solution can be scaled up or down however we want. Forces in those solution cancel each other out exactly, so any multiple of the solution is also a valid solution. We use the scaling freedom of the pre-tension solution to assure that we have at least targetForce_Newton in the ABCD lines, and that no line (incl top-line) get more tension than the configured maxPlannedForce in that direction.",

Our input variable `distances` contain the distance (L2-norm, euclidian distance) from each corner to some point that is encapsulated by the five anchors. We want to determine the xyz-coordinates of that point.\n\nSince this gives us 5 known variables and 3 unknown, this is an overdetermined system, and we're not guaranteed that the 5 known variables define one exact point in space. The `distance` values have been calculated from motors' rotational positions, and they don't know if lines are slack or over tight, and much less which lines are slack and which are not in that case. The `distance` values will generally be slightly off, and define a region in which we might wiggle, instead of a point.\n\nWe approach this by solving four linear systems and averaging over the result, which corresponds to all lines being ca equally slack.\n\nTo get the four linear systems, we start with five non-linear ones.\n|A - p| = l_a\n|B - p| = l_b\n|C - p| = l_c\n|D - p| = l_d\n|I - p| = l_i,\n\nwhere p is our unknown (x, y, z), A is the xyz of our A-anchor, and I is the top anchor.\n\nSquare both sides and move |A|² to the right hand side:\n\n-2*A*p  + |p|² = l_a² - |A|²\n\nNow subtract the last equation to get rid of |p|² (we expect the last equality to always hold, vertical lines are never slack).\n\n-2*A*p  - 2*I*p = l_a² - l_i² - (|A|² - |I|²)\n\nDivide by -2 and simplify to get four linear equations\n\n(A - I)*p  = -(l_a² - l_i² - (|A|² - |I|²))/2 = k_a\n(B - I)*p  = -(l_b² - l_i² - (|B|² - |I|²))/2 = k_b\n(C - I)*p  = -(l_c² - l_i² - (|C|² - |I|²))/2 = k_c\n(D - I)*p  = -(l_d² - l_i² - (|D|² - |I|²))/2 = k_d\n\nSay A' = A - I, and we get\n\nA'x A'y A'z | p_x   k_a\nB'x B'y B'z | p_y = k_b\nC'x C'y C'z | p_z   k_c\nD'x D'y D'z |       k_d\n\nThis is a linear but still overdetermined system (4x3).

      "Hangprinters spools stack the line windings on top of each other on the spool and tries to compensate for that in firmware. Hangprinter calls this phenomenon \"spool buildup\" and \"spool buildup compensation\". Hangprinter's buildup compensation is imperfect because the stacking is unpredicable and chaotic.

If you don't pull the effector downwards you're limited to the acceleration that gravity can provide, and gravity is really slow.

Multi-unit physical configuration is the only way to avoid re-routing of lines, and would be the only feasible one for larger scale Hangprinters.",

Precision movements are controlled by adjusting the lengths of the lines with tightly synchronized motors.",
      "The benefits of Hangprinter being No-Frame are many. The lightweight, compact format makes Hangprinter easy to transport and tidy away. The setup is quick since the anchors can be almost anywhere around the build volume. There are no ground preparation or alignment requirements. Quick-release anchors enable economical multi-usage of space. It frees up the area for other purposes as soon as the job is done.",
      "Torque Mode is a special motor mode that lets the user set a constant pull in the lines with any desired force. It is used to tighten lines or wind them onto or out from the spools. When winding out, the pull is set to almost zero, allowing the operator to attach the quick-release anchors. When preparing for print, torque mode ensures the optimal initial line tightness. When tidying, torque mode can create a slight pull that makes the lines follow the hand movements of the operator.",
      "High precision is achieved by directly measuring and compensating in software. The most useful measurements currently come from our custom-built hp-mark computer vision system. It measures the tool's position and orientation by keeping track of a set of markers.",

The routine is run only once and is divided into two steps:\n * Gather measurement data, like line forces, tool head positions, and motor rotations.\n * Compute the remaining physical attributes of the machine, like anchor positions, cable thickness and flexibility, and spool radii.",
      "Even our super stiff lines extend slightly due to the gravitational pull on the extruder. If left unaccounted for, this would cause sagging and precision loss. The flex compensation treats lines as if they were very tight springs. It uses these “springs” and some math to apply just the right amount of pull in every direction at all times.",
      "Since some lines point downward during printing, there is a risk of collision with wider prints during operation. Our line collision detector performs checks to determine in advance whether such collisions will occur. The detector lets operators plan and avoid surprises.",

In case of a sudden high force in the line (if someone trips in a line), the clamp is supposed to release the line. It's therefore important that the line protruding on the back side of the clamp is short. It's also important that all braiding is combed out near the end of the line so that the line can be clamped down flat, and no knot or tangle can form on the back side of the clamp, and prevent the safety mechanism from releasing the line.",

The patent describes the core features already featured in HangPrinter, causing controversy in the open source community. The RepRap project established a GoFundMe campaign to cover the legal costs in their upcoming action to challenge the patent.",

      "Configuration errors often lead to slack lines, uneven layers, and poor print quality.",
      "auto-calibration-for-hangprinter uses motor encoder and positional data, finds good configuration values and verifies them through a simulation tools called simulation.py",
      "Accurate configuration can reduce slackness and over-tightening by measuring lines and positions during setup.",
      "The simulation uses the same kinematics functions as Hangprinter's firmware for accurate predictions.",
